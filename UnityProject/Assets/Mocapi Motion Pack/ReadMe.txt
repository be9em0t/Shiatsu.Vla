Quick usage notes:

1. Mecanim integration - Integrate the entire Mocapi Animation Controller into your project.

Assign Mocapi_Locomotion Controller to your game avatar's Animation Controller slot.

2. Modular Mecanim integration - Merge only certain animation modules.

Connect them with transitons as needed.

You can easily integrate any Animation Clip from our FBX files into your code without using Mecanim.
